# Production Email Timeout Fix

## Problem
Users were experiencing timeouts during registration in production, causing:
1. First registration attempt times out
2. Second attempt shows "user already exists" 
3. Login shows "email not verified"

## Root Cause
- Email sending via Gmail SMTP was taking longer than 10 seconds in production
- Frontend timeout was set to 10 seconds
- Registration endpoint waited synchronously for email sending to complete

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Asynchronous Email Sending
- Modified all auth endpoints to send emails asynchronously
- Registration now responds immediately after saving user to database
- Email sending happens in background without blocking the response

### 2. Increased Timeouts
- Frontend timeout increased from 10s to 30s
- Email service timeouts set to 30s
- Added connection pooling and rate limiting

### 3. Better Error Handling
- Email failures no longer block user registration
- Proper logging for email sending status
- Graceful degradation if email service fails

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `backend/routes/auth.js` - Made email sending asynchronous
- `backend/lib/emailService.js` - Added timeout configurations

### Frontend  
- `frontend/lib/api.ts` - Increased timeout to 30 seconds

## Production Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in production:

```bash
# Email Configuration
EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
EMAIL_USER=your-production-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password  # Not regular password!
EMAIL_FROM=Virello Food <noreply@virellofoods.com>

# OTP Method
OTP_METHOD=email  # Use 'console' for development

# Frontend URL
FRONTEND_URL=https://virellofoods.com
```

## Testing
1. Test registration with slow network
2. Verify emails are sent asynchronously
3. Check that registration completes even if email fails
4. Test resend verification functionality

## Monitoring
- Check server logs for email sending status
- Monitor registration success rates
- Track email delivery rates

## Notes
- Users will still receive verification emails
- Registration completes faster
- Better user experience with immediate feedback
- Email failures don't prevent account creation
